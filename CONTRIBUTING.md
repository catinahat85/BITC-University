# Contributing to BITC University

First off, thanks for taking an interest in helping others hack their education. This project stays alive because the community finds new credit shortcuts and identifies when old ones stop working.

## How You Can Help

### 1. Update Course Info
If a provider (Saylor, Coursera, etc.) changes their ACE credit recommendation or a course is discontinued, please open an Issue or a Pull Request immediately.

### 2. Suggest New Tracks
Found a way to do a specialized degree in a field we haven't covered? Draft a new `.md` file in the `tracks/` folder and submit it.

### 3. Cost Optimization
If you find a cheaper way to earn a specific credit (e.g., a new free voucher program or a cheaper proctoring service), let us know.

## Contribution Guidelines

* **Keep it Direct:** No fluff. Use the existing table formats.
* **Verify Credits:** Ensure any course you suggest carries an active **ACE Credit Recommendation**. We don't want students taking courses that won't transfer.
* **Diversify:** Prefer "The Shield Strategy"—mixing academic theory with industry-recognized certifications.

## Pull Request Process

1. [Fork The GitHub Repo](https://github.com/catinahat85/BITC-University)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewTrack`).
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to the branch.
5. Open a Pull Request with a brief explanation of why the change is beneficial.
