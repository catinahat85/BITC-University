# **THE BITC MANIFESTO**

## **The Game Changed. Here's How to Win It.**

---

### **THE LIE YOU WERE TOLD**

*"Just learn to code and you'll get hired."*  
*"Skills matter more than degrees now."*  
*"Bootcamps are the new college."*

**The truth:** 81% of employers claim they hire for skills. But when they actually hire, 699 out of 700 picks still go to degree holders.

Why? Not because degrees prove competence. Because **volume broke the system.**

One remote job posting gets 3,000 applications. HR can't evaluate skill at that scale. So they filter by degrees—the crude shortcut that cuts 3,000 down to 50.

**You're not being rejected because you lack skills. You're being filtered out before anyone sees them.**

---

### **THE MARKET BIFURCATION**

Tech split into two worlds:

**World 1: AI Builders**  
PhDs, elite MS degrees, prestigious institutions. Building LLMs, doing research, making $400K. This is the 1%.

**World 2: AI Integrators & Operators**  
Building with AI, not building AI. Cloud engineers, DevOps, MLOps, cybersecurity, domain experts who apply AI to real problems. This is the 99%—and it's exploding.

**The middle collapsed.** Generic junior developers with a bootcamp certificate and no proof of work are drowning in competition.

---

### **THE REAL OPPORTUNITY**

Stop trying to out-credential Stanford PhDs.

**The money is in being the domain expert who can deploy AI:**

- Accountant who automates workflows with Claude
- Nurse who builds patient intake tools
- Project manager who implements supply chain optimization
- Paralegal who creates legal research systems

These "Centaur" roles (domain expertise + AI capability) are **massively underserved** and growing faster than pure engineering.

---

### **WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS (2025 REALITY)**

Single credentials are dead. **Credential stacking** is the new standard:

1. **Formal credential** → Gets past ATS filters  
2. **Technical certifications** → Proves you can do the work (AWS, Security+, Kubernetes)  
3. **Deployed portfolio** → Shows you actually ship  
4. **Domain expertise** → Makes you valuable instead of replaceable

**Plus:** One human advocate beats 1,000 cold applications. Referrals are 3-5x more effective than resume spam.

---

### **WHY BITC EXISTS**

Because the system is broken, but you still have to navigate it.

**We don't sell you false hope.** We give you the actual playbook:

✅ **Legitimate accredited degree for <$2K** → Gets past filters without debt  
✅ **Shield Strategy** → 12-18 months to bachelor's via maximum transfer credits  
✅ **Cert stacking guidance** → Technical proof employers actually respect  
✅ **Portfolio-first approach** → Build deployed work that gets interviews  
✅ **AI Integrator positioning** → Target the roles that are actually hiring

---

### **WHO THIS IS FOR**

- **First-gen students** who can't afford $100K in debt
- **Career changers** with jobs and families who need speed + affordability
- **Domain experts** (accountants, nurses, admins) who want to become AI-capable
- **Bootcamp survivors** who got certified but can't get interviews
- **Anyone stuck behind the paper ceiling** who has skills but lacks the filter-passing credential

---

### **WHAT WE'RE NOT**

❌ Another bootcamp promising "zero to engineer in 12 weeks"  
❌ A diploma mill selling worthless paper  
❌ A degree-worship cult pretending credentials = competence  
❌ A get-rich-quick scheme

**We're a pragmatic pathway** built by someone who actually did it—and generated >$10M in revenue to prove it works.

---

### **THE BOTTOM LINE**

The skills-first revolution is real for **AI Integrators and Operators.**

But you still need to get past the filters.

**BITC shows you how to do both:**

- Affordably (no debt trap)
- Legitimately (real accreditation)
- Strategically (stack credentials that matter)
- Quickly (12-18 months, not 4+ years)

---

### **YOUR CHOICE**

**Option 1:** Keep applying to jobs online, hoping this time will be different. (Spoiler: 3,000 other people just hit "Easy Apply" too.)

**Option 2:** Get the credential that passes filters + build the proof that gets offers.

**Merit beats pedigree. But first, you have to get in the room.**

**Welcome to BITC University.**  
**Let's build your receipts.**
