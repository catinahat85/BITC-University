# Capstone Certification

> **Note:** Capstone certifications are **not ACE credit eligible** and do not transfer as college credit. They are included as career-focused credentials that **build your "Shield"**—backing up your academic credentials with industry-recognized proof of technical competence that employers trust.


### Recommended Capstone (Choose Your Specialization):

#### Option 1: Hardware Focus — CompTIA Network+

| | |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | CompTIA |
| **Cost** | $349 |
| **ACE Credit** | ❌ Not Eligible |

**Why this certification?**

CompTIA Network+ is vendor-neutral and validates your ability to work with physical infrastructure, cabling, and hardware troubleshooting. It complements your CCNA's Cisco-specific content by proving you can work across any vendor's equipment. Ideal for roles focused on on-premise infrastructure and data center operations. **This is your Shield**—vendor-neutral proof of networking fundamentals.

---

#### Option 2: Cloud Focus — AWS Cloud Practitioner

| | |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Amazon Web Services |
| **Cost** | $100 |
| **ACE Credit** | ❌ Not Eligible |

**Why this certification?**

AWS Cloud Practitioner is the lowest-cost, highest-demand option. It proves cloud networking awareness and opens the door to the AWS ecosystem. With 60% retention from the track, this is the easiest capstone to pass. Best for hybrid infrastructure roles where you'll manage both on-premise and cloud resources. **This is your Shield**—entry into the dominant cloud ecosystem.

---

#### Option 3: Virtualization Focus — VMware VCP-DCV

| | |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | VMware |
| **Cost** | $250* |
| **ACE Credit** | ❌ Not Eligible |

**Why this certification?**

VMware VCP-DCV is the gold standard for datacenter virtualization. Enterprise environments run on VMware, and this cert validates your ability to manage virtual infrastructure at scale. *Note: VMware training is technically required, but self-study workarounds exist via vSphere home labs. **This is your Shield**—the enterprise virtualization credential.

### Recommended Association

| | |
|---|---|
| **Organization** | IEEE Communications Society |
| **Cost** | $29/year (IEEE member add-on) or $114/year (standalone) |
| **Website** | [comsoc.org](https://www.comsoc.org/) |

**Why join?** World's largest technical professional organization for networking and communications. Access to journals, conferences, and a global network of engineers. Student memberships available at reduced rates.
