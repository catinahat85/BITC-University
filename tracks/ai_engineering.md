# Track: AI Engineering

**Focus:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Math  
**Est. Cost:** $315  
**Time to Complete:** ~9 Months

**Target Degree:** B.A. in Liberal Arts

**Why:** This track is heavy on Math (Calculus/Stats) and deep technical Engineering. The General Liberal Arts degree provides the widest "bucket" to accept these hard-science credits without forcing unrelated business courses.
