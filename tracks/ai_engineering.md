# Track: AI Practitioner

**Focus:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Math  
**Est. Cost:** $315  
**Time to Complete:** ~9 Months

**Target Degree:** B.A. in Liberal Arts

**Why:** This track is heavy on Math (Calculus/Stats) and deep technical Engineering. The General Liberal Arts degree provides the widest "bucket" to accept these hard-science credits without forcing unrelated business courses.

## AI Practitioner

### Recommended Capstone: TensorFlow Developer Certificate

| | |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | Google |
| **Cost** | $100 |
| **ACE Credit** | ❌ Not Eligible |

**Why this certification?**

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate is the industry standard for validating machine learning skills. It's Google-backed and globally recognized by employers hiring for ML/AI roles. Your IBM AI Engineering coursework covers PyTorch and deep learning fundamentals—TensorFlow certification proves you can work across both major ML frameworks, making you a more versatile candidate. **This is your Shield**—the proof that your degree is backed by real, demonstrable skills.

### Recommended Association
