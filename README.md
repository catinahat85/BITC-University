## Goal & Mission Statement

### The Problem
U.S. Higher Education is out of control. The current system demands that you take on insurmountable debt just to meet the "minimum requirement" of a Bachelor’s degree. For most, this means spending four years and $40,000+ on theoretical lectures, only to find that HR still won't interview you because you lack professional certifications. You are left with a piece of paper, no job-ready skills, and a monthly bill you can't afford.

### The Mission
**BITC University** exists to break that cycle. Our mission is to provide a radical, open-source roadmap for the "Shield Strategy"—a method of education that prioritizes technical competence and financial freedom over institutional prestige.

We aim to dismantle the barrier to entry for high-paying tech and management careers by showing students how to:
1. **Hack the Cost:** Use the "aggregated credit" model to earn a nationally accredited degree for under $2000, with professional credentials to make you job-ready once you receive your diploma.
2. **Build the Shield:** Earn industry-standard certifications (Google, Cisco, Microsoft) that force recruiters to take you seriously.
3. **Finish Fast:** Execute a high-density, 9-month roadmap that respects your time and your intelligence.

### The Goal
Our goal is to provide a standardized, community-driven curriculum that bypasses the predatory tuition model. We don't care about "college life" or sports teams; we care about your ROI. By the time you graduate through this path, you won't just have an accredited degree to get past the HR filters—you'll have the professional badges that prove you can actually do the work.

**Stop overpaying for a seat in a classroom. Start building your career.**

</div>

### But Why Newlane University?

Newlane University offers a different path to an accredited liberal arts degree. They’ve swapped traditional semesters for a **competency-based model**. This means you don't sit through lectures; you simply prove you know the material. Once you pass their three-phase assessment, you move on.

**The Financial Advantage:**
The cost is the most striking part. You pay **$1,500 total** for an Associate’s or Bachelor’s degree. It starts with $249 upfront and $39 a month until you hit that cap. If you need more time after paying the full amount, you keep your access for free until you graduate.

**Built for the "Shield Strategy":**
* **Massive Transfer Capacity:** You can transfer up to **75% of your degree** from previous schools or ACE-recommended exams (like the ones in this repo).
* **Zero Hurdles:** There are no admissions hurdles or fixed schedules. You start immediately.
* **Ultimate Control:** They provide the framework and the accreditation while you control the pace.

> "Essentially, they provide the accreditation while you control the pace."


# The "Shield Strategy" Degree Plan
**University:** Newlane University (via Aggregated Transfer Credits)  
**Goal:** 9-Month completion | <$2000 Total Cost | Job-Ready Certifications

## The Strategy
This repository contains 7 distinct "tracks" designed to maximize transfer credits while ensuring professional viability. 

* **The Degree:** A nationally accredited Bachelor's degree (via Newlane University).
* **The Shield:** Industry-recognized certifications (Google, Microsoft, Cisco) that validate hard skills to employers who might look down on competency-based degrees.
* **The Cost:** Optimized by using "Free-to-Cheap" credit sources (Modern States, Saylor Academy) for all non-specialty coursework.

## The Universal Liberal Arts Core (15 Credits)
*Required for ALL tracks. Completed via Modern States (Free).*

# Contributing to BITC University

First off, thanks for taking an interest in helping others hack their education. This project stays alive because the community finds new credit shortcuts and identifies when old ones stop working.

## How You Can Help

### 1. Update Course Info
If a provider (Saylor, Coursera, etc.) changes their ACE credit recommendation or a course is discontinued, please open an Issue or a Pull Request immediately.

### 2. Suggest New Tracks
Found a way to do a specialized degree in a field we haven't covered? Draft a new `.md` file in the `tracks/` folder and submit it.

### 3. Cost Optimization
If you find a cheaper way to earn a specific credit (e.g., a new free voucher program or a cheaper proctoring service), let us know.

## Contribution Guidelines

* **Keep it Direct:** No fluff. Use the existing table formats.
* **Verify Credits:** Ensure any course you suggest carries an active **ACE Credit Recommendation**. We don't want students taking courses that won't transfer.
* **Diversify:** Prefer "The Shield Strategy"—mixing academic theory with industry-recognized certifications.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part
of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other
     material, or material used under an exception or limitation
     to copyright.

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license.
     Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and
     certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant.
     Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
     other reasons, including because others have copyright or
     other rights in the material. A licensor may make special
     requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
     described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
     encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            A. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            B. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

            C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

  b. ShareAlike.

     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.

       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
