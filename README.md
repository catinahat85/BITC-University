## The Mission

**The System is Broken.** Traditional college demands $40,000+ and 4 years for a degree that doesn't guarantee a job. You need the degree to get past HR filters, but you need hard skills to actually get hired.

**BITC University** is the roadmap to get both for under **$2,000**. We use the **"Shield Strategy"**:
1.  **Hack the Cost:** Use the "aggregated credit" model to earn a nationally accredited degree for pennies on the dollar.
2.  **Build the Shield:** Prioritize industry-standard certifications (Google, Cisco, Microsoft) that prove technical competence.
3.  **Finish Fast:** A high-density, 9-month curriculum that respects your time.
4.  **Skip the associate degree and general education filler by earning credentials that make you hirable now and slot you directly into Newlane’s bachelor programs.

**Stop overpaying for a seat in a classroom. Start building your career.**

### Why Newlane University?
Newlane is the engine that makes this possible. They replaced semesters with a **competency-based model**: you don't sit through lectures; you prove you know the material and move on immediately.

* **The Price Cap:** You pay **$1,500 total** for your degree ($249 start + $39/mo). No hidden fees.
* **The Pace:** Finish as fast as you can work. If you need longer than it takes to reach the $1,500 cap, you keep your access for free.
* **The Transfer:** Their policy allows transferring up to **75% of credits**, which is exactly what our tracks are designed to exploit.

## The ACE Credit Advantage
Every course and exam listed in BITC University was selected for one specific reason: they carry an active **ACE (American Council on Education) Credit Recommendation**.

* **Guaranteed Standard:** You aren't just "taking a course." You are completing a curriculum audited by academic experts to ensure it is equivalent to a course taught at a major state university.
* **Universal Language:** ACE recommendations provide a standardized "transcript" (usually via Credly) that registrars understand.
* **The "Shield" is Backed by Rigor:** When an employer sees your **Google Cybersecurity** or **IBM Full Stack** certificate, they see professional skills. When **Newlane** sees them, they see **ACE-validated college credit**.

## The Strategy
This repository contains 7 distinct "tracks" designed to maximize transfer credits while ensuring professional viability. 

### 1. The 75% Rule (The "Heavy Lifting")
Newlane allows you to transfer up to **75% of your total degree credits**. BITC provides exactly 45 credits of "Specialty Core" and "Electives" per track, plus the 15-credit Liberal Arts Core,allowing you to bypass an associate's degree requirement.

### 2. Industry Certifications as Academic Credit
Newlane’s **Credit for Prior Learning (CPL)** policy specifically recognizes industry-recognized certifications. We use certifications from **Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Cisco**. Because these providers carry ACE recommendations, Newlane can evaluate them for direct credit toward your major.

### 3. The Major Credit Limit (The 25% Guardrail)
Newlane policy states that up to **25% of required major credits** can be transferred. We prioritize transferring the "IT Baseline" and "Foundational" major courses via ACE credits (Google/IBM). This leaves the "Upper Division" specialty work for you to complete within Newlane's platform. Get hireable skills and well-respected credentials before you complete your bachelor.

### 4. CLEP & Saylor: The $0 Strategy
We utilize **Modern States** to get you free CLEP vouchers and Saylor for the remaining. You fulfill Newlane’s General Education and Liberal Arts requirements for $0, saving your 25% "Major Transfer" allowance for high-impact technical certifications.

## Transfer Checklist (Newlane Policy Alignment)

To ensure your BITC University credits are accepted, you must follow these Newlane-specific requirements:

1.  **ACE/NCCRS Status:** Every course in our tracks is selected because it currently carries **ACE** or **NCCRS** credit recommendations.
2.  **The "C-" Threshold:** For any credit that is not part of a previously completed degree, you must score the equivalent of a **C- or higher**. (Note: Most ACE-recommended providers like Saylor and Coursera require a 70% or higher to pass).
3.  **Official Transcripts:** You must have your transcripts sent **directly** to Newlane.
    * For CLEP: Send via College Board.
    * For Coursera/IBM/Google/Meta: Send your official **Credly** transcript.
    * For Saylor: Send via the Saylor Academy transcript portal.
4.  **2/3 Rule:** Your transfer courses must meet at least **two-thirds** of the instructional hours of the corresponding Newlane course. Our tracks focus on 3-credit equivalent courses to ensure this threshold is met.

**Email transcripts directly to:** `transcripts@newlane.edu`
